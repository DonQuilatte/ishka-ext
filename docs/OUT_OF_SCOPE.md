# Ishka Extension: Out of Scope Features

**Document Version**: 2.0 (Stability-First Revision)  
**Last Updated**: July 14, 2025  
**Purpose**: Clearly define features that are intentionally excluded due to stability and policy risks

---

## üö´ Why We Say No

The Ishka Extension follows a **stability-first philosophy** that prioritizes user trust and long-term reliability over feature completeness. This document lists highly desirable features that are intentionally excluded from our roadmap due to unacceptable risks.

### Risk Categories

- **üî¥ Very High Risk**: Features that could trigger account suspension or violate terms of service
- **üü† High Risk**: Features that depend on undocumented APIs or private implementation details
- **üü° Medium Risk**: Features that are brittle and likely to break with ChatGPT updates
- **üü¢ Low Risk**: Features that are technically feasible but outside our core focus

---

## üö´ Permanently Out of Scope

### üî¥ Very High Risk: Account Safety

#### Bulk Actions (Archive, Delete, Move)
**Why Excluded**: Automating multiple write/delete operations is the most likely feature to trigger rate-limiting or account suspension.

**User Request**: "Let me select 50 conversations and delete them all at once"

**Our Response**: 
- Risk of account flags for automated behavior
- Potential data loss if operations fail partially
- ChatGPT's rate limiting could block the user's account
- No safe way to implement undo for bulk deletions

**Alternative**: Export conversation list for manual review and deletion

---

#### Chat Renaming, Moving & Deleting
**Why Excluded**: Requires replaying undocumented PATCH, DELETE, and GraphQL calls that are prone to breakage and could trigger account flags.

**User Request**: "Add a rename button to conversations in the sidebar"

**Our Response**:
- ChatGPT's conversation management APIs are private and undocumented
- API calls use authentication tokens we cannot safely access
- Operations could fail silently, leaving UI out of sync
- Risk of corrupting conversation data or losing access

**Alternative**: Local tagging and organization system that doesn't modify ChatGPT's data

---

### üü† High Risk: API Dependency

#### Full Conversation Search (Live)
**Why Excluded**: Requires intercepting private GET API calls or aggressive DOM scraping, both of which are brittle and may violate terms of service.

**User Request**: "I want to search through all my conversation history instantly"

**Our Response**:
- ChatGPT's conversation loading is handled by private APIs
- Intercepting network requests violates browser security policies
- Full DOM scraping of all conversations would require loading them all, causing performance issues
- Search results could become stale as ChatGPT caches and paginations change

**Alternative**: Search within currently visible conversations and exported data

---

#### Folder / Project Manipulation
**Why Excluded**: Depends on a private and frequently changing GraphQL schema that is extremely brittle.

**User Request**: "Let me create new folders and move conversations between them"

**Our Response**:
- Folder operations use ChatGPT's internal GraphQL API
- Schema changes frequently without notice
- Failed operations could corrupt folder structure
- No way to safely test folder operations without risking user data

**Alternative**: Local tagging system that provides more flexible organization than folders

---

#### Integrated Web Search
**Why Excluded**: Relies on chaining external API calls and re-injecting data, which is complex and outside the core "local-first" strategy.

**User Request**: "Add a web search feature that automatically includes results in my prompts"

**Our Response**:
- Requires external API integrations (Google, Bing, etc.)
- API costs and rate limiting issues
- Privacy concerns with search query data
- Complex error handling for multiple external dependencies
- Increases extension complexity and maintenance burden

**Alternative**: Template system for common research prompt patterns

---

### üü° Medium Risk: DOM Fragility

#### Inline Threading / Branching
**Why Excluded**: Requires heavy, complex manipulation of the core chat DOM, making it exceptionally brittle.

**User Request**: "Let me branch conversations at any point and explore different directions"

**Our Response**:
- Would require deep manipulation of ChatGPT's conversation rendering
- Conversation state management is handled by React/frontend framework
- Risk of breaking ChatGPT's native functionality
- Extremely complex implementation with high maintenance cost
- UI changes could break the feature completely

**Alternative**: Template system for exploring different conversation directions

---

#### Live Token Management Tools
**Why Excluded**: Requires constantly reading the live conversation DOM, which is subject to frequent changes.

**User Request**: "Show me real-time token count for the entire conversation context"

**Our Response**:
- ChatGPT's token counting is handled server-side
- Conversation context includes system prompts we cannot access
- DOM structure for conversations changes frequently
- Real-time monitoring would impact performance
- Token count calculations would be approximations, not accurate

**Alternative**: Input token counter for prompts only, using local tokenizer

---

## üü¢ Lower Risk but Out of Scope

### Features Outside Core Focus

#### Custom ChatGPT Models
**Why Excluded**: Not related to organization and productivity enhancement.

#### Advanced AI Features (Summarization, Translation)
**Why Excluded**: Requires external AI APIs, increasing complexity and cost.

#### Social Features (Sharing, Collaboration)
**Why Excluded**: Requires server infrastructure and user accounts.

#### Browser Automation
**Why Excluded**: Outside the scope of ChatGPT enhancement.

---

## üîÑ Potential Future Consideration

These features will be reconsidered **only if** OpenAI releases supported public APIs that enable them safely:

### If OpenAI Provides Official APIs

#### Conversation Management API
- Safe conversation renaming, moving, deletion
- Folder/project management
- Bulk operations with proper rate limiting

#### Search API
- Full conversation history search
- Advanced filtering and organization
- Real-time search with proper pagination

#### Context API
- Accurate token counting for full conversations
- Context window management
- Model parameter access

### Monitoring for API Releases

We actively monitor:
- OpenAI developer documentation
- ChatGPT plugin/extension APIs
- Official developer communications
- Beta testing programs

When official APIs become available, we will evaluate them against our stability and user safety standards.

## üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How We Handle Feature Requests

### When Users Request Out-of-Scope Features

1. **Acknowledge the need**: "We understand this would be valuable"
2. **Explain the risk**: "Here's why we can't implement it safely"
3. **Offer alternatives**: "Here's what we can do instead"
4. **Show our principles**: "This aligns with our commitment to your account safety"

### Example Response Template

> Thank you for the feature request! We understand that [feature] would be incredibly useful for your workflow.
>
> Unfortunately, implementing [feature] would require [specific risk], which could potentially [consequence]. As part of our commitment to keeping your ChatGPT account safe and your data secure, we've decided not to pursue features that carry these risks.
>
> Instead, we'd like to suggest [alternative approach] which provides [benefits] while maintaining the stability and safety you can count on.
>
> We're constantly monitoring for official APIs from OpenAI that might enable us to implement [feature] safely in the future.
