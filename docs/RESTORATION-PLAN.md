## ⚠️ 4. Assumptions, Gaps, and Risks

### 🔍 Critical Assumptions

**1. Original Feature Scope**
- **Assumption**: Referenced PRD files contained comprehensive feature specifications
- **Risk**: May be implementing features that were planned but not validated
- **Mitigation**: Validate each feature against user needs before implementation

**2. Conversation Indexing Architecture**
- **Assumption**: IndexedDB is the correct storage mechanism for search functionality
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large conversation datasets
- **Mitigation**: Implement with configurable storage backends and performance monitoring

**3. Chrome DevTools Integration**
- **Assumption**: DevTools Protocol integration provides sufficient error capture
- **Risk**: May not capture all extension-specific errors
- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback error reporting mechanisms

### 📋 Documentation Gaps

**Missing Critical Files**:
- `docs/PRD_Features.md` - Detailed feature specifications and user stories
- `docs/PRD_Testing.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy and coverage requirements
- `docs/PRD_Scaffolding.md` - Expected project structure and coding standards

**Impact**: Without these files, restoration must be based on code analysis and inference from existing documentation.

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Reverse-engineer requirements from existing code and interfaces
2. Generate comprehensive PRD files based on analysis
3. Validate with team and update based on feedback

### 🚨 Technical Risks

**High Risk**:
- **Conversation Indexing Performance**: Large datasets may impact browser performance
- **Chrome DevTools Integration**: Complex WebSocket communication may be unreliable
- **Memory Management**: Automated cleanup may interfere with user workflows

**Medium Risk**:
- **Component Generator**: Template generation may not match current design patterns
- **E2E Testing**: Browser automation may be flaky in CI/CD environments
- **Configuration Manager**: UI changes may affect existing user workflows

**Low Risk**:
- **Export Enhancement**: Building on existing stable data-exporter
- **Design System Tools**: Leveraging existing token system
- **Documentation Generation**: Low technical complexity

### 🔧 Implementation Uncertainties

**1. Conversation Data Structure**
- **Question**: What is the optimal data structure for indexing ChatGPT conversations?
- **Research Needed**: Analyze ChatGPT DOM structure and conversation formats
- **Decision Point**: Choose between full-text indexing vs. structured data storage

**2. Search Performance Requirements**
- **Question**: What are acceptable search response times for different dataset sizes?
- **Research Needed**: Performance testing with realistic conversation volumes
- **Decision Point**: Balance between search completeness and response time

**3. Development Workflow Integration**
- **Question**: How should automated tools integrate with existing development processes?
- **Research Needed**: Team workflow analysis and developer feedback
- **Decision Point**: Level of automation vs. manual control

### 📊 Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics**:
- Search response time < 200ms for datasets up to 10,000 conversations
- Memory usage increase < 50MB during normal operation
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
- E2E test coverage > 80% of user workflows

**User Experience Metrics**:
- Search functionality intuitive without training
- Export tools support common formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- Configuration options comprehensible to average users
- Development tools reduce debugging time by 50%
